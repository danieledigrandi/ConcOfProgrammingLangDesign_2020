# INFOMPCD_2020

minhs1 contains the first project for the course in "Concepts of Programming Language Design", which consists in write an interpreter for the language "MinHs", a simplified version of Haskell. The scope and specifics are explained in file "evaluator.pdf".

The second project was about writing a language report for a programming language chosen by the student, and I decided to write a detailed report of Python.
