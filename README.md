# INFOMPCD_2020

minhs1 contains the first project for the course in "Concepts of Programming Language Design" (2020), which consists in writing an interpreter for the language "MinHs" - a simplified version of Haskell - in form of an abstract machine. The scope and specifics are explained in file "evaluator.pdf".

The second project was about writing a language report for a programming language chosen by the student, and I decided to write a detailed report of Python.
